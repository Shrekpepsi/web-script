# web-script
A general bash script to find response time for any web url/endpoint as per proper format.

# important note to remember

1-Need to add input from txt file so add all the url/endpoints to websites in a txt file first(urlhits.txt).

2-Using the following command first to remove carriage to prevent error:

# tr -d '\r' < urlhits.txt  > urlresponse.t
